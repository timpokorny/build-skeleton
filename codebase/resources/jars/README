Distributable Resources for Jar Files
--------------------------------------
It is common to include more than just compiled source code
in jar files. The convention of the build is to include all
resources under the directory corresponding to the jar file
name in the actual jar itself.

For example, given a sub-directory "myjar.jar" with the
following structure:

  myjar.jar/
     etc/
	   -- versions.txt
	 META-INF/
	   services/
	     -- some.class.name
     -- log4j.properties

During the build we'd expect the log4j.properties file, and
the etc and META-INF directories to be copied into the jar
file "myjar.jar" as it is produced.
